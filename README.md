# Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🎮

Welcome to my **Tic-Tac-Toe Game** project! This is part of my mini-project series where I build small, fun, and interactive applications to practice and showcase my skills in web development. This project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive UI**: A clean and user-friendly interface for playing Tic-Tac-Toe.
- **Player Turn Tracking**: Displays the current player's turn (X or O).
- **Win/Tie Detection**: Automatically detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a tie.
- **Reset Button**: Allows players to start a new game with a single click.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the game board and UI.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing game logic, handling user interactions, and dynamically updating the UI.
